# Movie Ticket Booking System

- Open to functions being scraped to make system easier to code

## Final Project
- Final Exam -> (Laboratory)
- 10-minute explanation
- Explain the data structure and algorithms used
- **Documentation**: Create a user manual in README.md
- document any changes and WHY in documentation.md for presentation showcase & summary
- **Version Control**: Set up a Git repository

## Project Breakdown
- **Core Components**:
  - **Ticket**: Central to the program
  - **Reservation System**: Handles all tickets
  - **Movies**: Users can select from a catalogue of movies
  - **Seating System**: Manages seating arrangements
  - **Theatre System**: Provides location and management of theatres
- **Data Storage**:
  - All information stored in separate Excel files
  - Use pandas for handling dataframes and Excel operations
  - In the future, expect modules to be handled by tkinter -> GUI approach

## Data Models

### Movie
- Attributes:
  - name
  - length (in minutes)
  - rating (e.g., PG, R) or (e.g., out of 10, or 5 stars)
  - showtimes (list of (date, time))

### Ticket
- Attributes:
  - name
  - email
  - seat
  - theatre location
  - movie (reference to Movie object)
  - date + time of movie reservation

### Reservation
- Attributes:
  - user (reference to User object)
  - tickets (list of Ticket objects)

## Reservation System
- **Functions**:
  - Authenticate based on name and email
  - Create tickets
  - Prevent ticket creation if no seats are left
  - Check for duplicate tickets and raise errors before creation
  - **Reservation History**: Allow users to view past reservations
  - **Cancellation System**: Enable users to cancel their reservations

## Theatre System
- **Functions**:
  - Manage systems for each theatre
  - Provide location and details of movies showcased
  - Add scalability for more flexibility when adding custom seats
  - **Seating Map**: Visual representation of available and reserved seats

## Catalogue of Movies
- **Functions**:
  - Display all movies alphabetically
  - Display movies by genre
  - **Search Functionality**: Allow searching by title, genre, or rating
  - **Movie Details**: Provide information

## Admin Utilities
- **Functions**:
  - Admin authentication system for managing movies
  - Add/remove movies from the catalogue
  - **Logging Changes**: Maintain a log of admin actions

## Data Management
- **Data Files**:
  - Separate Excel files for Users, Movies, and Reservations
- **Backup System**: Plan for regular backups of Excel files
- **Data Validation**: Implement validation for data read/write operations

## Implement Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Data Structures**
  - Stacks for user reservations
  - stacks can push a reservation and undo most recent reservation
  - Hashmaps for storing UID or user information
- **Algorithms**
  - Binary search for searching through Movie titles(sorted list)
  - Sort Movies in a list using Merge Sort
    - Reasoning:
      - Scalability: Best for when Datasets get large
      - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
      - Space Complexity: O(n) because of additional memory needed for mergin
      - Con: requires a lot of memory if datasets are big
